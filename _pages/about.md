I'm a fourth year undergraduate Computer Engineering student at [UF ECE](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/), advised by [Dr. Domenic Forte](https://dforte.ece.ufl.edu/) and [Dr. Ivan Ruchkin](https://ivan.ece.ufl.edu/) in the [Florida Institute for National Security](https://fins.institute.ufl.edu/) (FINS) and [Trustworthy Engineered Autonomy](https://tea.ece.ufl.edu/) (TEA) lab, respectively.

I've previously participated in the University Scholars Program and am currently a part of the AI Scholars Program through the UF Center for Undergraduate Research. This summer, I had the opportunity to work under [Dr. Navid Azizan](https://azizan.mit.edu/) at [MIT LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/) through the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP).

My research interests lie at the intersection between __uncertainty quantification__ and  __autonomous systems__. Ultimately, I aim to help create autonomous systems that are **robust**, **reliable**, and **intelligent**, especially when it comes to vehicular settings. I also have a broad interest in robotics, particularly in generalizable systems and multi-purpose robots that can continuously learn from their surroundings.

In FINS, I have worked on automated reverse engineering of circuit boards (PCBs) from X-ray CT images, as well as explainability for Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)-based counterfeit component detection. In the TEA Lab, I have worked on **safety chance prediction** for image-based control of autonomous vehicles using conformal prediction, as well as **distribution shift correction** and unsupervised domain adaptation for corrupted images in vision settings using Diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). At MIT, I worked on **uncertainty quantification** for Object Detection Transformers (DETRs) on both the object and image level.

Following my graduation in **Spring 2025**, I aim to pursue a PhD and continue my research on uncertainty quantification and reliable autonomous systems.
