I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [MIT AeroAstro](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/), advised by [Dr. Chuchu Fan](https://chuchu.mit.edu/) in the [REALM Lab](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/realm/).

I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Ivan Ruchkin](https://ivan.ece.ufl.edu/) and [Dr. Domenic Forte](https://dforte.ece.ufl.edu/) in the [Trustworthy Engineered Autonomy](https://tea.ece.ufl.edu/) (TEA) Lab and [Florida Institute for National Security](https://fins.institute.ufl.edu/) (FINS), respectively. During my undergraduate, I participated in the University Scholars and AI Scholars programs, and worked under [Dr. Navid Azizan](https://azizan.mit.edu/) at [MIT LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/) through the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP).

My research interests lie in creating autonomous systems that are **robust**, **reliable**, and **intelligent**. More specifically, I strive to develop robotic systems capable of robust, high-level, long-horizon planning in complex, human-rich environments.
