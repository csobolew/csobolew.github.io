I'm a fourth-year undergraduate Computer Engineering student at [UF ECE](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/), advised by [Dr. Domenic Forte](https://dforte.ece.ufl.edu/) and [Dr. Ivan Ruchkin](https://ivan.ece.ufl.edu/) in the [Florida Institute for National Security](https://fins.institute.ufl.edu/) (FINS) and [Trustworthy Engineered Autonomy](https://tea.ece.ufl.edu/) (TEA) Lab, respectively.

I've previously participated in the University Scholars Program and am currently in the AI Scholars Program through the UF Center for Undergraduate Research. This summer, I had the opportunity to work under [Dr. Navid Azizan](https://azizan.mit.edu/) at [MIT LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/) through the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP).

My research interests lie at the intersection between **uncertainty quantification** and **autonomous systems**. Ultimately, I aim to help create autonomous systems that are **robust**, **reliable**, and **intelligent**. More specifically, I strive to develop robotic systems capable of recognizing their uncertainty, localizing it to specific sensors and forms of input, and adapting accordingly at run time.

In FINS, I have worked on automated reverse engineering of circuit boards (PCBs) from X-ray CT images, as well as explainability for Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based counterfeit component detection. In the TEA Lab, I have worked on calibrated safety chance prediction for image-based control of autonomous vehicles using conformal prediction, as well as distribution shift correction and unsupervised domain adaptation for corrupted images in vision-based control settings using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). I am also working on drift detection and friction estimation in RoboRacer small-scale race cars. At MIT, I helped develop Object-level Calibration Error (OCE), a metric to determine the reliable subset of predictions in Detection Transformers (DETRs).

Following my graduation in **Spring 2025**, I intend to pursue a PhD and continue my research on uncertainty quantification and reliable autonomous systems.
